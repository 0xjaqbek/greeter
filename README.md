This dApp interacts with a smart contract that stores greetings, an almost basic/classic greeter dApp.
It have Owner greeting and visitors can retrive that just like other guests greetings by clicking on button, respectively.
You can also set new greetings by clicking on the 'Set User's Greeting' button.
Greetings count strats from ZERO. As always in my dApp's, no costs involved besides that used to run functions.
